# N_HideIdleMouse
Automatically hides the mouse cursor if it hasn't been moved for a while. Useful when playing in fullscreen mode.

## Compatibility
Since this plugin doesn't actually modify any RPG Maker-related code, it is very likely compatible to any JavaScript-based RPG Maker.

Tested and confirmed working:
- RPG Maker MV
- RPG Maker MZ

## Terms of Use
According to [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Known issues
Mouse only hides after user clicks, when on the left half or top quarter of the game window. Affects MV and MZ.

Workaround: Maximize the game window, or switch to fullscreen mode.

Plugin to launch game in fullscreen mode: [N_StartFullscreen][N_StartFullscreen]
